        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a computer language that makes
            up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text
            that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup
            language is a series of markings that tells web servers the style
            and structure of a document. HTML is very simple to learn and use.
          </p>

        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for
            describing the presentation of Web pages, including colours, layout,
            and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users. CSS
            is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of
            HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. CSS is
            popularly called the design language of the web.
          </p>

        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
            implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
            more than just sit there and display static information for you to
            look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
            animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can
            bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third of the web
            trio.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>What is React?</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and
            interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is
            an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only
            for the application's view layer. In Model View Controller (MVC)
            architecture, the view layer is responsible for how the app looks
            and feels. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at
            Facebook.
